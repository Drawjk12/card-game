This is a list of things that are missing visual indicators:
 * If you are reset to town after a battle, you lost. This happens if no cards are *active* when your turn ends
 * You attack first.
 * The crosses give bonuses, including energy, gold, cards
 * If stamina reaches 0, your energy is halfed
 * The 'flowerCactus' heals itself 5 hp and provides 5 energy every turn
 * Card stats are maintained through fights, (in battle) there are no visial indicators regarding the stats of the card you are choosing beyond the deck icon which can provide a sense of probability
 * Sleeping/Eating cost money (though not alot)
 * The goal is going through portal 2 which costs 5 Gold. It currently takes you to town
